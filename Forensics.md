1) After downloading the given file in the question, on analysis as a text file, it has 'BM' at the beginning indicating it is in a bitmap format.
2) I then converted the file into a bitmap file.
3) When i opened the file, it showed the following image:

4) I then printed the hex dump for the file.

5) On analysis of the hex dump, the pixel array of the bitmap header file was wrong because the byte at which it started was too high.
6) So instead, I used the address of the cursor offset 54 in the hex dump and put it in the pixel array of the header.
7) I then changed the height and size of the image so all the contents can be seen.

8) After editing the hex dump, i then opened the file again and got this image with the flag

1) I first downloaded the pptm file and then compressed it into a zip file

2) I then extracted all the files and I saw there were many directories and subdirectories in it.
3) I then went on linux command line and used 'ls -aR' to list all the files and its subdirectories.
4) I was browsing through the files listed and found a hidden file

5) I then ran a python code to remove all the space from the given text.

6) I realised it was base64 text so converted it to a string using an online converter: https://www.base64decode.org

7) I got the required flag to complete the level after conversion.
