# 1) caas

1) Using the link provided in the question it takes us to a page that tells us to enter a message at the end of a link

2) When doing so, a webpage with a cow comes up.

3) In the question, they have also provided a javascript file which has code.
4) During inspection of the source code i see '/usr/games/cowsay ${req.params.message}' which prints anything after /cowsay.
5) We can then use 'ls' command to print files available.

6) We can then use 'cat falg.txt' which probably contains the flag.
7) On doing so we get the required flag

   # Flag

# 2) Forbidden Paths

1) I open the website given in the question and see a bunch of books with an entry box.

2) I then used the directory '/usr/share/nginx/html/' given in the question but it says 'not authorized'.
3) I then used '../' to append to the pth to avoid the filtering of absolute file paths.
4) I used the command '../../../../flag.txt' and the required flag came up.

   # Flag

2) I then inspected the website and analysed the HTML code. I then entered random details and it took me to another page which told me my login failed.
3) I then inspected the second page and found a file which gave the authentication details.

4) I then entered the details given on the 'secure.js' and the required flag came up.
